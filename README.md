### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ , folks

I live in Chile, and I'm currently working as a freelancer on Workana.

I am always trying to learn new things, I am OpenSuse user and I love GNU/Linux. Although I am not a hippie open source lover. Currently I am learning JavaScript in depth. And I am studying blockchain development using truffle and tronbox.

I am looking to collaborate on any usefull project. Hopefully, that may help to descentralize the web.

I don't like political correctness. Hurray for freedom of speech. By speaking out loud your thoughts, new and original ideas may come to you.

Speak about your ideas. Don't care about what other people may think about you.
