### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ , folks

I live in Chile, and I'm currently working as a freelancer on Workana.

I am always trying to learn new things, I am OpenSuse user and I love GNU/Linux. Although I am not a hippie open source lover. Currently I am learning JavaScript in depth. And I am studying blockchain development using truffle and tronbox.

I am looking to collaborate on any usefull project. Hopefully, that may help to descentralize the web.
